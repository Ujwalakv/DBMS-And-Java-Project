## Database Setup

- Update your database credentials in the code:
  ```java
  DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/YOUR_DATABASE_NAME", "user", "password")
  ```
- Replace `YOUR_DATABASE_NAME` with your actual database name.
- The default username is `user` and password is `password` for sharing and testing purposes.
